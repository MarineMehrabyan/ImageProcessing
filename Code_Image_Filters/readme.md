____About Code the filters____

Code the filters refers to the mathematical operations applied to an image to alter its visual appearance. The filters you mentioned - Mean, Gaussian blur, Median, Min, Max, Sharp, Unsharp - are commonly used image filters in computer vision and image processing. Here's a brief description of each:

___Mean Filter:___ The Mean Filter is a low-pass filter that smooths an image by replacing each pixel's value with the average value of its neighboring pixels. It's useful for reducing noise in an image.

___Gaussian Blur:___ The Gaussian Blur is a low-pass filter that smooths an image by convolving the image with a Gaussian kernel. The amount of smoothing is determined by the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel.

___Median Filter:___ The Median Filter is a non-linear filter that replaces each pixel's value with the median value of its neighboring pixels. It's useful for removing salt-and-pepper noise in an image.

___Min Filter:___ The Min Filter is a non-linear filter that replaces each pixel's value with the minimum value of its neighboring pixels. It's useful for detecting edges in an image.

___Max Filter:___ The Max Filter is a non-linear filter that replaces each pixel's value with the maximum value of its neighboring pixels. It's useful for detecting edges in an image.

___Sharp Filter:___ The Sharp Filter is a high-pass filter that enhances the edges in an image by subtracting the blurred image from the original image. It's useful for making an image appear sharper.

___Unsharp Filter:___ The Unsharp Filter is a high-pass filter that enhances the edges in an image by subtracting a blurred version of the image from the original image and then adding the difference back to the original image. It's useful for making an image appear sharper while also preserving its overall detail.



Each of these filters has its own implementation in various programming languages and libraries. For example, in Python, these filters can be applied using libraries such as OpenCV or PIL.g
