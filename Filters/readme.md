__Image processing filters__

Image processing filters are mathematical operations that are applied to an image to modify or enhance its visual characteristics. These filters can be used to smooth or sharpen an image, remove noise, detect edges, and more.
To make an image x% more red in OpenCV, you can multiply the red channel of the image by a factor that is greater than 1. The factor can be calculated based on the percentage increase in red that you want. For example, if you want to increase the red channel by 20%, you would multiply the red channel by a factor of 1.2.

Conversely, to make an image x% less red, you would multiply the red channel by a factor that is less than 1. The factor can be calculated based on the percentage decrease in red that you want. For example, if you want to decrease the red channel by 20%, you would multiply the red channel by a factor of 0.8.

To modify the red channel of an image in OpenCV, you can use array indexing to access the red channel and then modify it directly. In a BGR color image, the red channel is the third channel (index 2) in the image array. You can multiply this channel by the desired factor to increase or decrease the amount of red in the image.

Note that you may need to clip the pixel values of the modified red channel to ensure that they stay within the range of 0 to 255. You can use the np.clip() function for this purpose.

__To apply this technique to all colors together__,  we can use the same approach, but apply it to each color channel separately.
In color images, each pixel is typically represented as a combination of three color channels: red, green, and blue (RGB). Therefore, to modify all color channels, we can simply apply the same technique we used for the red channel to the green and blue channels as well.
