____Compute and show histograms____


Histograms are a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. They are used to visualize the frequency distribution of a set of continuous or discrete data.

To compute a histogram, you first need to divide the range of the data into a set of equal-width bins. Then, you count the number of data points that fall into each bin and represent this count using vertical bars on the graph.
 The resulting histogram will display the data distribution, including the shape of the data, the center, spread, and any outliers or anomalies in the data.

Histograms can be useful for identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies in data and are commonly used in fields like statistics, data science, and business analytics.


In other words, the histogram shows how many pixels in the image have a certain brightness level. A peak in the histogram indicates that there are many pixels with a similar brightness level, while a valley indicates that there are few pixels with that brightness level.

For example, if you have an image with a lot of dark pixels (low intensity values) and a few bright pixels (high intensity values), you would expect to see a peak at the low end of the histogram and a valley at the high end of the histogram. Conversely, if you have an image with mostly bright pixels, you would expect to see a peak at the high end of the histogram and a valley at the low end.

So, the histogram gives us a way to visualize the distribution of pixel intensities in an image and can be useful for tasks such as image processing, segmentation, and object detection.
