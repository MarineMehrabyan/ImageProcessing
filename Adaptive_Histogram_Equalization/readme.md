______Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE)______

Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE) is a computer image processing technique that enhances the contrast of images by equalizing the histogram of the image in a local neighborhood. Unlike standard histogram equalization, which applies a global transformation to the entire image, AHE applies the transformation locally to small regions within the image.

In AHE, the histogram of a small region of the image is computed, and then a transformation function is applied to that region to equalize its histogram. This process is repeated for each overlapping region of the image, resulting in a globally enhanced image with better contrast and detail.

AHE is used for image enhancement in a wide range of applications, including medical imaging, surveillance, and remote sensing. It is particularly effective in enhancing the contrast of images with non-uniform lighting, such as images captured in low-light conditions or images with shadows. By enhancing the contrast of the image, AHE can improve the visibility of important features and make it easier for humans or computer algorithms to interpret the image.
