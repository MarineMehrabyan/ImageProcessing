___Extract “Channels” of an Image___

In the context of digital image processing, an "image channel" refers to a grayscale image that represents a single color component of a color image.

A color image typically consists of three color channels: red, green, and blue (RGB), although some image formats may include additional channels, such as alpha channel for transparency or a separate channel for luminosity.

To extract channels from an image means separating out each color channel from the original color image, creating three separate grayscale images, one for each channel. This can be done using various software tools and programming libraries for image processing, and the resulting grayscale images can be used for further analysis and processing, such as image enhancement, segmentation, or feature extraction.
