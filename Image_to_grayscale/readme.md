__Convert image to grayscale__

 Converting an image to grayscale is a common image processing task that involves removing the color information from an image, resulting in a grayscale image where each pixel is represented by a singlevalue corresponding to its brightness level. 

__The First example__ is a simple Python script that uses OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) to load an image file and convert it to grayscale. The script displays both the original and grayscale images side-by-side.

__The Second example__ are is more complex example of converting an image to grayscale using the Applying Adaptive Thresholding.


 
___Requirementsi:___
Python 3.x
OpenCV (installed via pip or from source)

___Usage:___
Place the script in the same directory as the image file you want to convert to grayscale.
Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.
Run the script by entering "python3 scriptname.py" in the terminal/command prompt.
The script will load the image, convert it to grayscale, and display both images side-by-side.
Press any key to close the image windows.
Note: Replace "image1.jpg" in the script with the actual name of the image file you want to convert. The script assumes that the image file is in the same directory as the script.



___Applying adaptive thresholding___

Applying adaptive thresholding is a common technique used in image processing to convert a grayscale image into a binary image. This is achieved by segmenting the image into two parts: foreground and background, where the foreground represents the object of interest and the background represents the rest of the image.

Adaptive thresholding is different from simple thresholding in that the threshold value is not fixed across the entire image. Instead, the threshold value is calculated for each pixel based on the intensity values of the neighboring pixels in a local neighborhood. This local neighborhood can be a rectangular or circular region centered around each pixel.

The calculation of the threshold value can be performed using different methods, but a common approach is to use a weighted average of the pixel intensities in the local neighborhood, with the weights given by a Gaussian distribution. The center pixel's intensity value is then compared to the threshold value, and if it is greater than the threshold, it is assigned to the foreground; otherwise, it is assigned to the background.

Adaptive thresholding is useful in situations where the lighting conditions or contrast of an image varies across the image, making it difficult to choose a single threshold value that separates the foreground from the background effectively. It is commonly used in image segmentation, object detection, and OCR (optical character recognition) applications.

In OpenCV, applying adaptive thresholding can be accomplished using the cv2.adaptiveThreshold() function, which takes the input image, the maximum pixel value, the adaptive method, the threshold type, the block size, and a constant value as arguments. The output is a binary image where the foreground pixels are set to the maximum pixel value and the background pixels are set to zero.
