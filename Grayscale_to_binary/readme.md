______Grayscale to binary______ 

Grayscale to binary image conversion is a process of thresholding the grayscale image, where each pixel in the image is assigned a value of either 0 or 255 based on a threshold value. A binary image is a type of image that consists of only two pixel values, typically 0 and 255, representing the background and foreground, respectively. The threshold value is a key parameter in the conversion process, and it determines the level of sensitivity of the algorithm to the intensity variations in the image.

There are two main types of thresholding techniques: global thresholding and adaptive thresholding. Global thresholding involves applying a single threshold value to the entire image, which may not be suitable for images with non-uniform lighting or contrast. Adaptive thresholding, on the other hand, calculates a local threshold value for each pixel based on its neighborhood and is more robust to lighting and contrast variations.


The "global_thresholding.py" is an example code in Python using OpenCV to perform global thresholding on a grayscale image. 


The "adaptive_thresholding.py" is an example code in Python using OpenCV to perform adaptive thresholding on a grayscale image. 





____Global Thresholding____

The first step is to apply a global threshold value to the image to separate the object of interest from the background. We can choose a threshold value by analyzing the histogram of the grayscale image, which shows the distribution of the pixel intensities.
We  use the numpy library to compute the histogram of the pixel intensities in the image using the histogram function. We then plot the histogram using matplotlib's pyplot function.

Next, we use OpenCV's threshold function to determine the threshold value using Otsu's method. Otsu's method is a commonly used method for automatically computing the threshold value based on the histogram of the image. We apply the threshold to the original image using the threshold function with the THRESH_BINARY+THRESH_OTSU flag.


____Adaptive Thresholding____

The first step to  apply a Gaussian blur to reduce noise in the image. After that, we use the cv2.adaptiveThreshold() function to apply adaptive thresholding. The first argument is the input image, the second argument is the maximum value for the threshold (in this case, 255), the third argument is the type of adaptive thresholding (in this case, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C), the fourth argument is the type of thresholding (in this case, cv2.THRESH_BINARY), the fifth argument is the size of the adaptive window (in this case, 11), and the sixth argument is the constant used in the threshold formula (in this case, 2).




____More detailed differences____

Adaptive thresholding and global thresholding are two commonly used techniques for image thresholding.

In global thresholding, a single threshold value is applied to the entire image, based on a global intensity value. This method assumes that the foreground and background of the image have distinct intensity levels. Pixels with intensities above the threshold are set to white, and those below are set to black. Global thresholding is a simple and fast method, but it may not work well for images with uneven illumination or when the foreground objects have varying intensity levels.

On the other hand, adaptive thresholding is a method that sets a threshold value for each pixel based on its local neighborhood, which is determined by a window size. This method is particularly useful when the lighting conditions in the image are uneven, or when the foreground objects have varying intensity levels. Adaptive thresholding calculates the threshold value for each pixel as a function of the mean or median intensity of the neighboring pixels. This approach allows for more accurate separation of foreground and background in images with uneven illumination.

The key difference between adaptive and global thresholding is that adaptive thresholding calculates the threshold value for each pixel based on its local neighborhood, while global thresholding applies a single threshold value to the entire image. This means that adaptive thresholding can better handle images with uneven illumination, while global thresholding may be more suitable for images with a consistent intensity distribution.

In summary, the choice between adaptive and global thresholding depends on the characteristics of the image and the specific application requirements.





____There are alsoother thresholdings____

___Otsu's thresholding:___ Otsu's thresholding is a method for automatically determining the optimal threshold value for image segmentation. It works by maximizing the between-class variance of the foreground and background pixels in the image. This method assumes that the image has a bimodal intensity distribution, and can be used to segment the image into two classes (foreground and background) based on the optimal threshold value.

___Canny edge detection:___ Canny edge detection is a popular method for detecting edges in images. It works by first applying a Gaussian filter to reduce noise in the image, then computing the gradient magnitude and orientation of the image. Next, non-maximum suppression is applied to thin the edges to a single pixel width, and hysteresis thresholding is used to link adjacent edge pixels into a continuous curve. The output of Canny edge detection is a binary image with edges represented as white pixels.

___Watershed segmentation:___ Watershed segmentation is a method for segmenting an image into regions based on the local intensity minima and maxima. It works by treating the image as a topographical map, with the intensity values representing the elevation. A "flooding" process is then applied to the map, starting from the local minima and filling each region until it reaches a local maximum. The boundaries between the regions are then used to create the segmented image.
