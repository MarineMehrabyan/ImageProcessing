__________Histogram matching__________


Histogram matching is a method that is used to adjust the color distribution of an image to match that of a reference image. This can be useful in cases where we have two images with different lighting conditions or different color distributions, and we want to make them more visually similar. In such cases, histogram matching can be used to align the color distributions of the images, making them look more similar to each other.


The finished result of histogram matching is an output image with a histogram that matches a specified reference histogram. Histogram matching is used to adjust the contrast of an image by modifying its pixel intensity distribution to match a desired reference distribution. 

The output image has the same overall appearance as the original image but with enhanced contrast and detail. This technique is commonly used in image processing applications, such as medical image analysis, computer vision, and remote sensing.

The process involves computing the histograms of both the input image and the target histogram, and then mapping the input image's pixel values to new values such that the resulting histogram matches the target histogram.

Histogram matching is commonly used in image processing and computer vision applications, such as color correction, image enhancement, and pattern recognition. It can help to normalize the appearance of images that have been captured under different lighting conditions, or to adjust the contrast and brightness of an image to improve its visual quality.
